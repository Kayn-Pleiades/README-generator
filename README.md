## Description 

## Process

### Commit 1: Create README.md
Created repository on GitHub

### Commit 2: base files
Copied over the base files for the homework

### Commit 3: gitignore
Set up the git ignore file

### Commit 4: inquirer
inquirer installed 

### Commit 5: product
Firstly, I want a place for the generated README to go. I don't want it to just replace this one. An app that deletes its instructions as part of it's use doesn't seem like it would be a very sustainable app. I created a folder titled "product" and placed in it a blank README to be edited 

### Commit 6: test
Now I want to edit the file I just created using my code. I can successfully write to the file. Each time I run the code, it overwrites the file.
