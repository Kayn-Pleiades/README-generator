## Description 
This app allows users to quickly generate professional quality README files for their repository with ease!

## Installation 

## Process

### Commit 1: Create README.md
Created repository on GitHub

### Commit 2: base files
Copied over the base files for the homework

### Commit 3: gitignore
Set up the git ignore file

### Commit 4: inquirer
inquirer installed 

### Commit 5: product
Firstly, I want a place for the generated README to go. I don't want it to just replace this one. An app that deletes its instructions as part of it's use doesn't seem like it would be a very sustainable app. I created a folder titled "product" and placed in it a blank README to be edited 

### Commit 6: test
Now I want to edit the file I just created using my code. I can successfully write to the file. Each time I run the code, it overwrites the file.

### Commit 7: title
The first part of the README is the title, so I have it prompt the title, and then write that into the file.

### Commit 8: questions
Moved the question text to the question array.

### Commit 9: table of contents
I added the table of contents. I've also decided to break each aspect of the README into seperate parts. Not only does this make it look more organized, but if I need to go back and fix something, I can more easily locate what I wish to edit. 

### Commit 10: additional items
Added the additional sections the guidelines require to my Table of Contents

### Commit 11: description
I decided to do type: editor instead of input for the description. There are multiple benefits to this: Especially that you can easily add line brakes and that going over and making changes before commiting the text is much more accessible. At least on Windows you do need to click save when you exit out of the file, but I think that will cause no less confusion than how clicking enter, either by accident or to attempt to enter a new line, sumbits the prompt. As long as I make it clear in the instructions, all should be dandy!

### Commit 12: install
Installation parts added. 

### Commit 13: base for license
Added the useage, credits, and the base for the license part. I will finish off the skeleton before going back and finishing the license section.

### Commit 14: skeleton
Switched to prompts for simplicity. Might switch back later, but I worry that prompts are what the guildlines are expecting. Will ask about in office hours. Finished the skeleton.

### Commit 15: email link
fixed email link

### Commit 16: license
Added list of licenses. Added a dummy LICENSE file to simulate how the README will link to the user's license in their repository. 

### Commit 17: Test
Added what hopefully will add a badge. Going to test it and then push so I can view how it looks on GitHub!

### Commit 18: Email link 2
Badge works! but email link is funky so I'm going to try something else.

### Commit 19: Video Filmed
Video is filmed and edited. Now to figure out how to embed it.
