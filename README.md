## Description 

## Process

### Commit 1: Create README.md
Created repository on GitHub

### Commit 2: base files
Copied over the base files for the homework

### Commit 3: gitignore
Set up the git ignore file

### Commit 4: inquirer
inquirer installed 

### Commit 5: product
Firstly, I want a place for the generated README to go. I don't want it to just replace this one. An app that deletes its instructions as part of it's use doesn't seem like it would be a very sustainable app. I created a folder titled "product" and placed in it a blank README to be edited 

### Commit 6: test
Now I want to edit the file I just created using my code. I can successfully write to the file. Each time I run the code, it overwrites the file.

### Commit 7: title
The first part of the README is the title, so I have it prompt the title, and then write that into the file.

### Commit 8: questions
Moved the question text to the question array.

### Commit 9: table of contents
I added the table of contents. I've also decided to break each aspect of the README into seperate parts. Not only does this make it look more organized, but if I need to go back and fix something, I can more easily locate what I wish to edit. 

### Commit 10: additional items
Added the additional sections the guidelines require to my Table of Contents
